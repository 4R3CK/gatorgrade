# GatorGrade: A Python Tool to Implement GatorGrader

## Project Description

GatorGrade is an automatic grading tool that can be used to check assignments through user-created checks. GatorGrade is the newer Python-based version of GatorGradle which can be found on GitHub at this link: https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgradle/blob/master/README.md . GatorGrade takes in a gatorgrader.yml file and tests each check for correctness against the code that it is connected to.
